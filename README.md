# Card Bazaar

Card Bazaar is a Magic: The Gathering singles marketplace concept site.  
This version (1.3 FIXED) fetches live card images from the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api)  
and displays them in a two-column grid with interactive hover overlays showing pricing and condition variants.

## Features
- Fetches MTG card art from the Scryfall API
- Hover overlay showing placeholder price, rarity, condition, and inventory data
- Variant selector for different conditions/prices
- Double-click card art to add it to your cart and remove items from the cart menu

*Future versions aim to source real pricing and inventory data.*
