## Summary
- Shipped front-page upgrades, search, navigation overhaul, Binder page, Auction (BETA), Gold/Profile popups, and a new Sell Cards flow with email confirmation.

## What Shipped
- Trending/Infinite Scroll: Home feed fills to ~200 with related cards; headliners added; supports local image overrides and path configs.

- Search: Header search (name-only) that renders a single-card result.
  - Files: `app.js:540`
- Navigation: Removed Standard/Modern/Commander/Sealed; equalized button sizes; reordered; My Profile under Login; My Binder sized uniformly.
  - Files: `app.js:612`

  - Files: `server/index.js:205`, `server/mailer.js:27`

## Decisions
- Keep Auction and Sell flows as prototypes (no real payouts) with local storage + email confirmation.
- Centralize “sell” entry as a header button; remove right‑side Sell Cards.
- Remove Standard/Modern/Commander/Sealed from sidebar to focus nav on core MVP conversion.

## Open Issues / Blockers
- Auction listings not persisted in DB; page has no detail view.
- Search returns a single result view only; no multi‑result dropdown or keyboard nav.
- Support page is still a placeholder.

## Next Actions (Tomorrow)
- [ ] Add `config/sell.json` to curate the Sell page inventory.
- [ ] Persist Auction listings (SQLite table), add simple listing detail view.
- [ ] Enhance search UX (dropdown, keyboard, routeable `/search?q=`).
- [ ] Ship Support page skeleton with top issues.
- [ ] Add image assets for headline cards under `assets/cards/`.
